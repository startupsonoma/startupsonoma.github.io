Startup Sonoma County provides a productive and dynamic environment to help
Sonoma county technology startups and entrepreneurs achieve success faster, and
more consistently, than they may otherwise accomplish alone.  With a physical
space and a  culture of sharing knowledge, skills, and resources, North Bay
entrepreneurs will find it easier to innovate and invest in the success of
Sonoma county.

## Upcoming Events

* April 12th, 7-8:30pm at 537 4th St: [Startup Pitch Spring Training](https://www.meetup.com/Startup-Sonoma/events/249103096/)


### Cowork and Coffee

Every Wednesday from 1:00 - 3:00pm, current and future members of Startup
Sonoma County are invited to "Cowork and Coffee" at Acre Coffee at 621 4th St,
Santa Rosa.

Additional events can be found on **[our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Startup-Sonoma/)**.


## The Space

Sonoma county is littered with fragmented pockets of innovation, garage
hackers, telecommuters, and hidden-away new businesses. Startup Sonoma County
aims to rally those talented entrepreneurs into a more cohesive virtual and
physical community. By providing a shared **physical incubation space** in
[Santa Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_Ca),
the largest city north of San Francisco, new startups will benefit from direct
discussions and frequent collaboration with their fellow North Bay
entrepreneurs.

Unlike a coworking space, Startup Sonoma County is not a public
bill-by-hour-space, but rather a location where new startups are incubated,
ideas are shared, and mutual support is the norm. New members are expected to
“give before they get” and must help the entire community grow and thrive.
