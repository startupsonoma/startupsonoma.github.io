## The Space

Sonoma county is littered with fragmented pockets of innovation, garage
hackers, telecommuters, and hidden-away new businesses. Startup Sonoma County
aims to rally those talented entrepreneurs into a more cohesive virtual and
physical community. By providing a shared **physical incubation space** in
[Santa Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_Ca),
the largest city north of San Francisco, new startups will benefit from direct
discussions and frequent collaboration with their fellow North Bay
entrepreneurs.

Unlike a coworking space, Startup Sonoma County is not a public
bill-by-hour-space, but rather a location where new startups are incubated,
ideas are shared, and mutual support is the norm. New members are expected to
“give before they get” and must help the entire community grow and thrive.
